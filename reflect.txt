Working on Python is like speaking english language in coding world...makes it so easy to connect to a virtual machine..."Python is considered as eqivalent of english language by coders throughout the world because of its syntax and python is actually more friendly language as  compared to C/C++....C++ is a COMPLEX language...it has more syntax rules as well as program conventions Python has vast number of libraries and applications as compared to C++ but C++ has its benifits as well line C++ has a lot faster than python when compared to compilation of code it is so because C++ is statically typed, where as python supports dynamic typing,
Memory management in Python is automatically programmed where as C++ uses a lot of pointers which makes it vulnerable to memory leaks where as there is a garbage colletor in python therefore use of pointers is limited and this is something i loved about python.
In my first semester we had a subject called APS145 there we studied the logic of how to solve fibonnaci series and Rock paper scissors. Therefore is became easy for us to solve the lab.
